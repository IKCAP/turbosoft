	<p>
		This portal provides access to <a href="http://geosoft.earthcube.org">Geosoft's
			Turbosoft system</a> by allowing you to browse, and add models to the

	<h2>About Geosoft</h2>
	<p>Although scientists program a lot of code to analyze their data,
		that important software is often not shared and rarely preserved. The
		GeoSoft project brings together computer scientists, geoscientists,
		and social scientists to assist scientists to describe basic
		characteristics of their code and share it. GeoSoft will be a social
		site where scientists can discover alternative approaches to release
		free software, use intelligent interfaces to explain how their
		software works, and form productive communities around software
		projects. This research has the potential to fundamentally transform
		geosciences by making scientific software readily available to
		researchers and citizen scientists for efficient data analysis.</p>

	<p>
		If you are interested in using the Turbosoft system with your own
		framework, or in setting up your own installation of a Turbosoft
		portal, please <a href="mailto:varunr@isi.edu">contact us</a>.
